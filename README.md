# GitHub-Users
GitHub Users created by Patryk 'UltiPro' WÃ³jtowicz using JavaScript, AJAX and Fetch.

The application allows you to load GitHub users starting with ID equal to 1, as well as searching for a specific user by its nickname. Users are displayed on cards with a nickname and ID. After clicking on the user's card, we are taken to its GitHub profile in a new tab.
